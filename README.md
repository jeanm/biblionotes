# BiblioNotes

Quick-and-dirty annotated bibliography generator. It parses a `BibTeX` file, extracting entries and citation keys. For each citation key, it looks for a corresponding markdown file. If the file is found, it parses it into HTML and adds it to the bibliography.

You can see an example [here](http://www.maillard.it/ab/).
